# IJC 
Both assignments were part of [The C Programming Language](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/210310/) 2019/2020 course.

## First assignment - bit operations, message encoding/decoding
The goal of [first assignment](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/study/courses/IJC/public/DU1.html.en) was to encode a "secrete" message into an image and then also be able to decode that message as well.



## Second assignment - hash table, C tail command
The [second assignment](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/study/courses/IJC/public/DU2.html.en) was divided into two independent parts. The first part of the assignment was creating the tail utility that should work as a Linux tail command in its most basic form. The second part of the assignment is a command-line application that counts the occurrences of the words in text using a hash table.
